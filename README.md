# MultiMachineDAEControl
The codes correspond to our paper about  load frequency control for power systems DAE. The main program is the main code to run the simulation. To run it, you'll need MATPOWER to solve the power flow problem, PST at least for the description of generator parameters, and YALMIP with MOSEK solver to solve LMIs.
